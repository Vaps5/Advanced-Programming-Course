Brigitte Solorzano is a senior student of agroindustry engeineering. She is doing her thesis in Analysis of the Effects of Alkaline Hydrolysis with Calcium Hydroxide on the In Vitro Protein Digestibility of Cricket Flour (Acheta domesticus). We are working together to obtain the best concentration of calcium hydroxide for the best chitin decomposition in the in vitro digestibility analysis. 
The class made in this task used the data of Brigitte's pilot test of chitin decomposition. To see the results of the pilot test, access with the institutional account to the following site:
